    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These are very delicious! I made them at the height of peach season, and
      every single family member said 'Eww' as I was cooking. Those Ewws quickly
      became Wows when I brought these to the table, however. Every last one has
      always been eaten.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>8 ounces pancetta bacon, thickly sliced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
      <li>12 ounces pizza dough, or more to taste, cut into quarters</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 cup olive oil, or as needed</li>
      <li><small>1/2</small> cup ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme, or to taste</li>
      <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>20 slices fresh peach</li>
      <li>
        <small>1/4</small> cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, or to
        taste
      </li>
      <li>4 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat an oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Line baking sheets
        with <br />
        aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle pancetta into a cold skillet and drizzle 1 teaspoon olive oil
        over <br />
        pancetta. Cook and stir pancetta over medium heat until browned and
        <br />
        caramelized, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove pan from heat and cool pancetta in
        the <br />
        oil in the skillet
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 1 dough quarter on a work surface and lightly dust with flour;
        roll into a <br />
        1/8-inch-thick irregularly shaped crust. Strech dough with your hands to
        an <br />
        even thickness; let rest on the work surface for 5 minutes. Repeat with
        <br />
        remaining dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat about 1 cup olive oil, reaching about 1/2-inch depth, in a heavy
        cast iron <br />
        skillet over medium-high heat. Fry each piece of dough until browned and
        <br />
        cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. The first side will lighter
        than <br />
        the second side. Drain the crusts on paper towels.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer pizza crusts, lighter-side up, to prepare baking sheets. Spread
        about <br />
        2 tablespoons ricotta cheese onto each crust using the back of a spoon.
        <br />
        Sprinkle about 1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme over ricotta layer. Sprinkle
        pancetta <br />
        over the ricotta-thyme layer; season with black pepper. Nestle about 5
        peach <br />
        slices onto each pizza, working around the pancetta pieces. Sprinkle 1
        <br />
        tablespoon Parmesan-Reggiano cheese over each pizza. Drizzle about 1
        teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil over Parmesan-Reggiano layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and peaches are
        lightly <br />
        browned and tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool pizzas for 5 to 10 minutes on
        the <br />
        baking street.
